# Dog_vs_Cat_Classification(Transfer Learning)

Project Title: Dog vs Cat Classification with MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning

# Description:
This project implements a deep learning model for classifying images of dogs and cats using transfer learning. It leverages the pre-trained MobileNet V2 model for image feature extraction and fine-tunes it on a dedicated dog and cat dataset.

# Libraries and Technologies:

Python: As the primary programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn : For data visualization .
OpenCV : For image processing tasks .

# Algorithm:

Transfer Learning: The project employs the MobileNet V2 model, which is pre-trained on a massive image dataset (ImageNet), and fine-tunes it on the dog and cat dataset. This approach capitalizes on the pre-trained features for efficient and accurate classification.


# Results:
Test Loss = 0.0812455490231514
Test Accuracy = 0.9775000214576721

# potential enhancements 

1.Using data augmentation techniques for increased dataset diversity.
2.Implementing hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
